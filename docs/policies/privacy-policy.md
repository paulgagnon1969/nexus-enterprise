## Introduction

NFS Group ("we," "us," or "our") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use Nexus Contractor Connect and our mobile application Nexus Mobile (the "App").

---

## Information We Collect

We collect **location data** (precise or approximate, depending on the feature) only when you actively use the App and only if you grant permission through iOS Location Services.

- We request access to your device's location solely to provide the core functionality of the App (e.g., recording job site locations for daily logs and timecards).
- This data is processed **on-device** or transiently as needed for real-time functionality.
- We do **not** store your location data on our servers.
- We do **not** collect any other personal information, such as name, email, device identifiers, contacts, photos, usage analytics, or any other data.

No data is collected automatically in the background, and no data is transmitted to us or any third parties unless strictly required for the immediate App feature you're using.

---

## How We Use Your Information

We use location data **exclusively** to deliver the App's intended features while you are using it. We do not use it for any other purpose, including advertising, analytics, marketing, profiling, or sharing with third parties.

---

## Sharing and Disclosure

We do **not** share, sell, rent, or disclose your location data (or any other information) with any third parties. We do not engage in tracking across apps or websites.

---

## Your Controls and Choices

- You control location access entirely through your device's settings (Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services > Nexus Mobile).
- You can choose "While Using the App," "Never," or adjust precision.
- If you deny or revoke permission, the App's location-dependent features may not function.
- Since we do not store or retain any data, there is no data to access, correct, delete, or export.

---

## Children's Privacy

Our App is not directed to children under 13 (or the applicable age in your region). We do not knowingly collect data from children.

---

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. We will post the revised version here with an updated effective date.
