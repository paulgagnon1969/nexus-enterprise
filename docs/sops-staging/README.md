# SOP Staging

This folder contains draft SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) generated by Warp when features are pushed to production.

## Workflow

1. **Warp generates** → SOP Markdown file lands here
2. **Review** → Check content, update if needed
3. **Import to Nexus** → Move to "Unpublished SOPs" group in Nexus Documents
4. **Publish** → Admin reviews and publishes with appropriate role visibility

## File Naming Convention

`{module-name}-sop.md`

Examples:
- `document-import-sop.md`
- `timecard-approval-sop.md`
- `user-management-sop.md`

## After Import

Once an SOP is imported into Nexus Documents, you can either:
- Delete the file from this folder (Nexus is the source of truth)
- Keep it for version control reference

See `WARP.md` → "SOP Production Contract" for full details.
