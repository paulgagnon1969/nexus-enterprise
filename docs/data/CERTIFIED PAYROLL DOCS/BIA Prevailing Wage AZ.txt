================================================================

Note: Executive Order (EO) 13706, Establishing Paid Sick Leave
for Federal Contractors applies to all contracts subject to the
Davis-Bacon Act for which the contract is awarded (and any
solicitation was issued) on or after January 1, 2017.  If this
contract is covered by the EO, the contractor must provide
employees with 1 hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours
they work, up to 56 hours of paid sick leave each year.
Employees must be permitted to use paid sick leave for their
own illness, injury or other health-related needs, including
preventive care; to assist a family member (or person who is
like family to the employee) who is ill, injured, or has other
health-related needs, including preventive care; or for reasons
resulting from, or to assist a family member (or person who is
like family to the employee) who is a victim of, domestic
violence, sexual assault, or stalking.  Additional information
on contractor requirements and worker protections under the EO
is available at
https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/government-contracts.

Note: Executive Order 13658 generally applies to contracts
subject to the Davis-Bacon Act that were awarded on or between
January 1, 2015 and January 29, 2022, and that have not been
renewed or extended on or after January 30, 2022. Executive
Order 13658 does not apply to contracts subject only to the
Davis-Bacon Related Acts regardless of when they were awarded.
If a contract is subject to Executive Order 13658, the
contractor must pay all covered workers at least $13.30 per
hour (or the applicable wage rate listed on this wage
determination, if it is higher) for all hours spent performing
on the contract in 2025.  The applicable Executive Order
minimum wage rate will be adjusted annually.   Additional
information on contractor requirements and worker protections
under Executive Order 13658 is available at
www.dol.gov/whd/govcontracts.

Unlisted classifications needed for work not included within
the scope of the classifications listed may be added after
award only as provided in the labor standards contract clauses
(29CFR 5.5 (a) (1) (iii)).


----------------------------------------------------------------

The body of each wage determination lists the classifications
and wage rates that have been found to be prevailing for the
type(s) of construction and geographic area covered by the wage
determination. The classifications are listed in alphabetical
order under rate identifiers indicating whether the particular
rate is a union rate (current union negotiated rate), a survey
rate, a weighted union average rate, a state adopted rate, or a
supplemental classification rate.

Union Rate Identifiers

A four-letter identifier beginning with characters other than
""SU"", ""UAVG"", ?SA?, or ?SC? denotes that a union rate was
prevailing for that classification in the survey. Example:
PLUM0198-005 07/01/2024. PLUM is an identifier of the union
whose collectively bargained rate prevailed in the survey for
this classification, which in this example would be Plumbers.
0198 indicates the local union number or district council
number where applicable, i.e., Plumbers Local 0198. The next
number, 005 in the example, is an internal number used in
processing the wage determination. The date, 07/01/2024 in the
example, is the effective date of the most current negotiated
rate.

Union prevailing wage rates are updated to reflect all changes
over time that are reported to WHD in the rates
in the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) governing the
classification.

Union Average Rate Identifiers

The UAVG identifier indicates that no single rate prevailed for
those classifications, but that 100% of the data reported for
the classifications reflected union rates. EXAMPLE:
UAVG-OH-0010 01/01/2024. UAVG indicates that the rate is a
weighted union average rate. OH indicates the State of Ohio.
The next number, 0010 in the example, is an internal number
used in producing the wage determination. The date, 01/01/2024
in the example, indicates the date the wage determination was
updated to reflect the most current union average rate.

A UAVG rate will be updated once a year, usually in January, to
reflect a weighted average of the current rates in the
collective bargaining agreements on which the rate is based.

Survey Rate Identifiers

The ""SU"" identifier indicates that either a single non-union
rate prevailed (as defined in 29 CFR 1.2) for this
classification in the survey or that the rate was derived by
computing a weighted average rate based on all the rates
reported in the survey for that classification. As a weighted
average rate includes all rates reported in the survey, it may
include both union and non-union rates. Example: SUFL2022-007
6/27/2024. SU indicates the rate is a single non-union
prevailing rate or a weighted average of survey data for that
classification. FL indicates the State of Florida. 2022 is the
year of the survey on which these classifications and rates are
based. The next number, 007 in the example, is an internal
number used in producing the wage determination. The date,
6/27/2024 in the example, indicates the survey completion date
for the classifications and rates under that identifier.

?SU? wage rates typically remain in effect until a new survey
is conducted. However, the Wage and Hour Division (WHD) has the
discretion to update such rates under 29 CFR 1.6(c)(1).

State Adopted Rate Identifiers

The ""SA"" identifier indicates that the classifications and
prevailing wage rates set by a state (or local) government were
adopted under 29 C.F.R 1.3(g)-(h).  Example: SAME2023-007
01/03/2024. SA reflects that the rates are state adopted. ME
refers to the State of Maine. 2023 is the year during which the
state completed the survey on which the listed classifications
and rates are based. The next number, 007 in the example, is an
internal number used in producing the wage determination.
The date, 01/03/2024 in the example, reflects the date on which
the classifications and rates under the ?SA? identifier took
effect under state law in the state from which the rates were
adopted.

-----------------------------------------------------------

WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS

1) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can
be:

           a) a survey underlying a wage determination
           b) an existing published wage determination
c) an initial WHD letter setting forth a position on
a wage determination matter
d) an initial conformance (additional classification
and rate) determination

On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests
for summaries of surveys, should be directed to the WHD Branch
of Wage Surveys. Requests can be submitted via email to
davisbaconinfo@dol.gov or by mail to:

            Branch of Wage Surveys
            Wage and Hour Division
            U.S. Department of Labor
            200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
            Washington, DC 20210

Regarding any other wage determination matter such as
conformance decisions, requests for initial decisions should be
directed to the WHD Branch of Construction Wage Determinations.
Requests can be submitted via email to BCWD-Office@dol.gov or
by mail to:

            Branch of Construction Wage Determinations
            Wage and Hour Division
            U.S. Department of Labor
            200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
            Washington, DC 20210

2) If an initial decision has been issued, then any interested
party (those affected by the action) that disagrees with the
decision can request review and reconsideration from the Wage
and Hour Administrator (See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7).
Requests for review and reconsideration can be submitted via
email to dba.reconsideration@dol.gov or by mail to:

            Wage and Hour Administrator
            U.S. Department of Labor
            200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
            Washington, DC 20210

The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the
interested party's position and any information (wage payment
data, project description, area practice material, etc.) that
the requestor considers relevant to the issue.

3) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an
interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative
Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board).  Write to:

            Administrative Review Board
            U.S. Department of Labor
            200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
            Washington, DC 20210.
